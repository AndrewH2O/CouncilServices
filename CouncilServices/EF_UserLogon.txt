The default logon did not work, kept reporting invalid login at the user screen
Instead of asking for email change the logon based on name and password

Changes were made to 
1) AccountViewModel.cs - LoginViewModel to include UserName instead of Email
2) Login view was updated
3) Account controller method 
		public async Task<ActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model, string returnUrl)
		
		this line was refering to email instead of UserName
		var result = await SignInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(model.UserName, model.Password, model.RememberMe, shouldLockout: false);

Look at the Migrations/ApplicationDbContext seed method for password and usernames
